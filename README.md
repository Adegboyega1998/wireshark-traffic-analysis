# ðŸ¦ˆ Wireshark Network Traffic Analysis

This project demonstrates how to detect and analyze network activity generated by a simulated attack using Wireshark. It replicates a real-world scenario where an attacker uses Nmap to scan a Windows system while a defender monitors the network with Wireshark.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Set up a virtual lab environment using VirtualBox
- Capture live traffic using Wireshark on a Windows VM
- Simulate an attack using Nmap from Kali Linux
- Use Wireshark filters to detect and analyze suspicious packets

---

## ðŸ§° Tools Used

- Kali Linux (Attacker)
- Windows 10 (Victim & Wireshark monitor)
- Wireshark
- Nmap
- VirtualBox with Host-Only Adapter

---

## ðŸ§ª What I Learned

- How to simulate a real-world reconnaissance attack using Nmap
- How to identify SYN scans using Wireshark
- The importance of using packet filters for effective analysis
- How attacker traffic appears from a defenderâ€™s perspective
